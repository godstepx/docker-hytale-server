This has been fixed! 🎉

**What changed:**

The server now supports **both** input methods simultaneously:
- Direct stdin (Portainer Attach / `docker attach`)
- File-based input (`echo "command" > /data/server.input`)

**How it works:**

Both input sources are merged into a single FIFO that feeds Java. You can now:
- Type directly in Portainer Attach Console
- OR send commands via the file pipe

**To update:**

```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

The container logs will show either:
- `Interactive input enabled (Portainer Attach supported)` - if TTY is detected
- `Non-interactive mode (use /data/server.input for commands)` - if no TTY

Please test and let me know if this works for you!
